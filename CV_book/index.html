Hiring managers and employers look at a CV for less than 30 seconds to filter out candidates and choose the qualified ones. Then, they pick the qualified pile of CVs and start from there to find their ideal candidate. For you, as student, a fresh graduate, or a young job seeker, a CV is your primary tool and is designed to help you start the job search. As you read further through this section, you will learn how a CV will help you in every step of the way until you land your dream job as well as how to build a descriptive and a unique CV to stand out from the competition.</p></h3></div>
			<div style="border-left: 2.5px solid black"><h1 style="margin-left: 10px">C.V witing basics</h1><h3 style="margin-left: 20px"><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20px">CV's are widely used in the Middle East and North Africa as a primary step to send out a job application. They help large organizations to filter out candidates and divide the CVs into two piles of qualified vs. non-qualified applicants. Also, CVs are commonly used in post-graduate programs' application forms. They are used when applying for scientific or medical research programs, as well as other academic fields, as they give admissions counselors an idea if the program would suite the candidate and whether it complements their achievements and how the program will help them further pursue their career goals. We will guide you through the essentials of a CV and guidebook 1 will give you more tools to create your effective CV.</p></h3></div>
			<div style="border-right: 2.5px solid black"><h1 style="margin-left: 10px">C.V witing basics</h1><h3 style="margin-left: 20px"><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20px">Offline refers to the fact that you will be doing the submission manually through networking, attending events, and seeking help from colleges and universities. Taking it from a marketing perspective, when you apply for job, you are selling and marketing yourself to potential employers. Offline submission is the same as outbound marketing, which requires physical action. Letting people around you know that you are searching for a job and reaching out to people who are employed in the same field as yours, meeting up with them, doing some informational interviews, and if you get the chance handing in a copy of your CV and cover letter. While some industries still require offline submission of CVs and cover letters, the continuous developments of technology and that is facilitating our daily lives and tasks have made online submission the dominant and most efficient manner.</p></h3></div>
			<div style="border-left: 2.5px solid black"><h1 style="margin-left: 10px">C.V witing basics</h1><h3 style="margin-left: 20px"><p align="justify" style="margin-right: 20px">Online CVs and cover letters are the easy way around in the majority of industries and most employers nowadays prefer to receive applications and CVs online. There are many online platforms for job seekers and employers with very easy CV building and uploading tools. Also, such platforms come with recruitment software implemented that allows employers to scan CVs, sort them, and filter out candidates instantly. Online CVs can be created via online job board, some social media accounts, company's career sections, and other online recruitment solutions used by employers and professional recruitment sites. Your accounts should always look professional yet personal; employers can search you on the internet within a minute. The power in online CV's and cover letters lies beyond the advantages of being fast and easy to use; its about wider reach and exposure, the more accurate matchmaking technology, and the ability to create a personal brand as will be discussed in another section of the course.</p></h3></div> -->
